# Project 3: Linear Regression
### by Ganesh M

Linear Regression project, part of the Udacity [Machine Learning Engineering Nanodegree](https://in.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009).

## Linear regression project

Welcome to the linear regression project, linear algebra is the basis of many machine learning algorithms, in which you will not use any library, with what you have learned before to solve a linear regression problem.

## Project Description

All tasks that need to be done are in linear_regression_project.ipynb, including programming questions and proof questions.

## Project Contains

This project consists for the following files:

* linear_regression_project.ipynb
* proof.pdf
* linear_regression_project.html
* linear_regression_project.py
